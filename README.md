# 🧑💬 TalkGPT 🗨️🤖

A simple speech interface app for GPT.

It uses the standard [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) for speech-to-text and text-to-speech. And of course, GPT3.5 as the core AI model.

Currently fully only English and Slovenian (experimentally). For Slovene I'm using Polish text-to-speech setting(Slovenian voice is unsupported).

The model has no context of chat history - each line/prompt is completely independent.
